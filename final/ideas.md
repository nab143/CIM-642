Final Project Ideas

1) Upgrade midterm project (Glove Light):

	The purpose of the glove light is to use hand gestures to control different modes of light. 

	As of now, the glove light uses 5 flex sensors to control 5 basic red LED lights with one hand gesture. As the hand opens, the LEDs become brighter. As the hand closes, the LEDs dim to off. 
	
	To upgrade the project I would like to switch the 5 basic red LED lights with 4 Neopixel LED rings (36 LEDs total). These LEDs are much brighter than the basic LED. As well, the LED rings give more options for different light modes. They can change colors, brightness, and animate. Animation is made possible with the ability of each LED to be programmed separate and together.

2) Musical Drum Sticks

	A piezo and LEDs will be connected to two drumsticks. The sound and light will change as the user moves the drumsticks. For example; as the drumstick lowers, the sound will get deeper and the LED will become brighter.

2) Runaway Car

	Two distance sensors or photoresistors will be attached to the front and back of toy car. Motors will be used to create forward and backward movement of the toy car. When the sensors recognize an object in front of it, it will tell the motors to move the toy car in the opposite direction. LEDs will turn green when there is nothing blocking the sensors. LEDs will turn red when the sensors pickup movement.
