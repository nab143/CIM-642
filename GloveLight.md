# Glove Light

## Project Description:
## This smart glove is intended to convert sign language into different LED modes. Using flex sensors and LEDs, hand gestures will be used to control light brightness, and color. For example; Light will become brighter as a hand opens and dim to off when the hand closes. Other gestures will control different light colors and effects.

## How its Made:

## The glove uses five 4.5" flex sensors (1 on each finger), to read the hand gesture and tell the LED how to react. 

## Step 1: Give common ground and electricity (5V) from the Arduino to the breadboard. 

## Step 2: Connect the flex sensors to the breadboard with 10k resistors. 

## Step 3: Give analog connections to each of the flex sensors. I used:

## Flex Sensor 1: A0 = Thumb

## Flex Sensor 2: A1 = Index

## Flex Sensor 3: A2 = Middle

## Flex Sensor 4: A3 = Ring

## Flex Sensor 5: A4 = Pinky

## Step 4: Connect the LEDs rings to the breadboard with 220 resistors.

## Step 5: Give pin connections to the LEDs rings.

## Step 6: Connect the LEDs rings to a flex sensor on the breadboard.

## Step 7: Connect Arduino to PC and upload the code.
