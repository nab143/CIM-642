For my "Glove Light" project, I used a sleeved barbecue glove and attached the hardware to the front and back of the glove. In order to hide the hardware, I covered the front and back of the glove with black fabric in the same exact shape. I also poked 5 small holes in a circular shape in the palm of the glove and pushed the LEDs through. 

For the 3D model, I sketched the accurate dimensions of the glove. When the sketch was complete, I extruded the shape, leaving 5 holes in the shape of a circle where the LEDs would be. In this model, I did not round the edges to give it a more robotic look. The original prototype of the glove is rounded and covered in fabric. A metal robotic shape would give the project a stronger look.
