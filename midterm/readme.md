Idea 1: Glove Light

Description: The Glove Light will look similar to the Iron Man hand. Using flex sensors and LEDs, hand gestures will be used to control light brightness, and color. For example; Light will become brighter as a hand opens, and the light will turn off when the hand closes. Other gestures will control different lighting and lighting effects.

Equipment:
(1) Arduino
(5) 4.5 inch flex sensors
(2) Breadboards
(5) 10k resistors
(?) LEDs
(?) Jumper cables

Packaging:
-Glove (to hold the LEDs in the palm of the hand)
-Plastic or fabric (to cover the remaining hardware)

Idea 2: Musical Drum Sticks

Description: A piezo and LEDs will be connected to two drumsticks. The sound and light will change as the user moves the drumsticks. For example; as the drumstick lowers, the sound will get deeper and the LED will become brighter.
